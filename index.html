  <p>
   Dear little angel watching you grow has been one of my greatest joys.
   You are officially at that age where your dreams, and aspirations are within reach, and your options are endless.
   Don't hold back, go make your mark, be fearless, and be determined, and the universe will set the stage for your wins.
   May your new age bring you many opportunities and special moments filled with significant and positive impact.
   In all that you do, let God be at the center of it all, love humanity and may God in his mercy guide you towards the right path, protect and strengthen you. 
   I pray that your day sparkles as brightly as your personality, as exciting, fun and laughter as you, princess &#128536;.
   Happy birthday my favorite Gurl.
