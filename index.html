  My shining star I couldnâ€™t be more proud of the amazing young person youâ€™re becoming. Watching you grow and glow has been such a blessing, and I know this new year will bring even more wonderful experiences your way.

    Youâ€™re at that perfect age where your dreams are not just dreams, but things you can start turning into reality. The world is yours to explore, and I have no doubt youâ€™ll make your mark with everything you do. Be bold, stay fearless, and remember that with hard work and faith, thereâ€™s no limit to what you can accomplish.
    
    As you step into this new year, I pray that you continue to be surrounded by love, laughter, and beautiful memories. Keep God at the center of your heart, trust His plan, and know that Heâ€™s always guiding and protecting you on this incredible journey.
    
    May your day be filled with the same sparkle, joy, and warmth that you bring to our family and everyone around you. Iâ€™m so excited for all that lies ahead for you, my precious sister!
